I create the chat. It's just work for the current User. I need to add the multiplayer function.

I continue my research on Mirror, the Unity extension to handle multiplayer. I added a manager, who takes care of creating the server, as well as retrieving and synchronizing information between clients.

I created the player, an object which will be generated for each client, and which will contain its information, and the methods to communicate with the others.

I linked the player with the dialog window, so that he can write, and send information to others. I have a few bugs to fix.

I spent the day fixing the bugs. Text sometimes displayed incorrectly. I also added the names of the players, for the moment generated by the identifier.
